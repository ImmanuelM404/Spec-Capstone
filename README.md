1. Does the All-Star break hurt or improve a NBA player's performance ? (Use sample size of 1-5 players) 

2. Analysis of this problem gives insight on player's performance after All-Star break and gives insight on a player's ability to help a team make a late push for the playoffs.  

3. Tech Stack: pandas/numpy (dataframe), matplotlib/plotly (data visuals), nba_api (data source), beautifulSoup/Selenium (web scraping), excel/notes (data file), request (online)

4. Data Sources: Nba_Api, probasketballapi, NBA.com, ESPN  

5.Acceptance Criteria: As a user I should be able to evaulate whether a NBA players performance improved or declined after All-Star break by total points, rebounds, assist and turnovers (player efficency) by comparing to before All-Star break stats.
